 Doctor-matching-platfrom# Hospital Management System

 Vision

The Hospital Management System is designed to simplify and secure the process of booking and managing patient appointments through a blockchain-based solution. By leveraging smart contracts, the system ensures transparency, security, and immutability of appointment records.

 Features

- **Book Appointments**: Patients can schedule appointments by providing their name and the desired date.
- **View Appointments**: Patients can retrieve and view their own appointment history.

Flowchart

1. User Interaction
   - User visits the web interface.
   - User enters their name and appointment date.
   - User submits the form.

2. **Web3 Interaction
   - JavaScript collects form data.
   - JavaScript sends the data to the smart contract via Web3.

3. Smart Contract Execution
   - The smart contract records the appointment.
   - Appointment details are saved on the blockchain.

4. Data Retrieval
   - User requests their appointment data.
   - JavaScript fetches and displays appointments on the web page.

 Smart Contract Details

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HospitalManagement {
    struct Appointment {
        string patientName;
        uint256 date;
    }

    mapping(address => Appointment[]) public appointments;

    function bookAppointment(string memory _patientName, uint256 _date) public {
        appointments[msg.sender].push(Appointment(_patientName, _date));
    }

    function getAppointments() public view returns (Appointment[] memory) {
        return appointments[msg.sender];
    }
}
```



Future Scope

1. User Authentication**: Implement a system to verify user identity and secure data access.
2. Appointment Management**: Add features for canceling or modifying appointments.
3. Admin Interface**: Develop an admin dashboard for overseeing all appointments.
4. Notification System**: Integrate notifications and reminders for upcoming appointments.
5. Enhanced Security**: Explore multi-signature and advanced encryption options.

 Setup Instructions

1. Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the provided Solidity contract to an Ethereum test network (e.g., Rinkeby).
2. Update the Web App**: Insert the deployed contract address in `app.js` where indicated.
3. Configure ABI**: Replace the ABI array in `app.js` with the ABI of your deployed contract.
4. Host and Test**: Host the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files on a local server or web hosting platform and test the functionality.
 Notes

- Ensure MetaMask is installed and configured for the Ethereum network.
- This implementation serves as a foundational example; consider adding additional features and enhancements for a production-ready application.
